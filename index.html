<h1>The sun</h1>
<h2>Discovery</h2>
About a century ago a series of protected bubbles were found floating within the sun, sun protective channels were found that led to these bubbles. Over the next years pioneers, worshippers and scientists have migrated to live on these bubbles, aptly named the burning archipelago. The study to find who made these bubbles continues but no one has made any progress.The sun is used as a tourist spot, mining operation and sometimes beings who live on the sun come as diplomats. 
<h2>Geography- </h2>The sun is an always changing landscape, sunspots and solar flares dot the surface, where large amounts of energy ripped open portals to the fire plane for brief periods of time. The burning archipelago is considerbly more stable then the sun, consisting of force bubbles with towns or platforms suspended within. The study of these bubbles proves unfruitful, with the common idea of these bubbles being magical in nature. Even though scientists do not know how these bubbles are made, the study provides great deal of insight into other studies. Movement from bubble to bubble is done through a type of ferrie named "line-huggers" that use the connections between the bubbles to travel.
<h2>Residents- </h2> Not much can live on the sun, though there are certain fire immune creatures such as efreets and salamanders who travel down for unknown reasons. Most people live in the burning archipelago, a melting pot of all races, though almost half of them are humans. The government leaders as well as the corperation owners that call the sun home are mostly humans. There is a sect of androids who call the foundries of the sun home, working towards the idea of making heat resistant bodies so they can work in the more unshielded areas of the archipelago. Solarians are naturally interested in the sun, a few kasathas have founded monasteries in the smaller bubbles among the outskirts of the archipelago. <br> In a little-understood psychic resonance, most lashuntas who visit the burning archipelago are beset with a constant feeling of some impending doom rising up from the star bvelow to engulf the floating domes. This constant assault means that only the toughest lashuntas can stay in the archipelago, and those that stay tend to be isolationist. They have taken over an entire bubble for their own use despite the discouragement from race-based bubbles. <br> Hailing from the elemental plane of fire, efreet are a common sight. While it might seem to outsiders that efreet are constantly at each others throats, efreet society is rooted in respect and unity, deep down all effreet are on the same side and anyone who assumes otherwise will end up finding trouble
<h2>Society- </h2>The sun is recognized as pact worlds communal territory while the burning archipelago is considered an independent protecterate, free to govern itself. Each bubble city elects its own representive who argues on behalf of their bubble in the senate. The senate allows anyone with clout to speak and voice opinions, this includes corperations, trade guilds and senators. The church of Sarernrae is the most powerful force in the bubble cities, though they have no wish to control the entire archipelago, they rely on the rest of the power players cooperation to keep the settlement on an even level.<br><br> Various companies own staellites in orbit around the sun, most notably NatuReal compounds Ltds. so-called "jungle boxes"- transports filled with genetically engineered planys that sometimes react strangely to solar radiation. 
<h2>Dangers and threats- </h2> Lashuntas who live in the burning archipelago for any length of time retreat into the psychic equivalent of a defensive stance, becoming less tolerant, more isolationist, and more paranoid. Their claimed bubble of Asanatown has the trappings of a military base, and rumors swirl about what takes place behind their sealed blast doors. Every so often a seemingly harmless initiative by one of the corporations or governments of the archipelago will set off the lashuntas, sending their agents into a flurry of activity. This results in the project being abandoned, sometimes after what seems to be a series of accidents. These outburtsts have become more and more frequent lately, causing tensions between asanatown and many of the archipelagos powers. <br><br> There is a sect of sarenites who believe that only the smallest modifications should be made to the archipelago because it is destined for a purpose only known to sarenrae and any modification will make this purpose fail with disatrous results. few outside of this sect see restoring the bubble as a priority so this sect only acts through diplomacy and negotiation. <br><br> Ambassadors from the elemental plane of fire have reluctantly spoken about ancient civilizations that exist within the suns deeper layers, none have spoken to these beings so not many people believe them though people still try to contact them, believing them to be the progenitor race, maybe even being the first ones of Aballon.
<h2>Locations of note- </h2> <h4>AbadarCorp Hypermarket</h4> One of the largest areas accessible by pedistrians in the fireside bubble is the Hypermarket, a series of storefronts almost entirely given over to wholesale. those walking its promenades tend to make purchases in the thousands of units, the amount of money changing hands here means that securrity is tight. AbadarCorp holds perhaps 10% of the security contracts in the Archipelago and all of their arrangements are coordinated from a sleek, key-shaped edifice called pin tower rising above the hypermarket
<h4>Archipelago senate chambers</h4> Located in Dawnshore, the seat of government convenes at least once a month to discuss matters that effect the entierty of the bubble cities. Powerful people and trade groups are allowed to weigh in on decisions. 
<h4>Asanatown</h4>The bubble that connects corona to dawnshore, it is almost completely populated by Lashunta immigrants. They put a half-hearted show of appearing to be a typical ethnic enclave and their industry allows for enough trade to keep the lights on though many people believe their focus is somewhere else. Those who watch the market notice the Lashuntas stockpiling more weapons then they could ever use.
<h4>Brass Bazaar</h4> Located in the center of Corona, this large market is mostly staffed by Efreet and other denizens of the elemental plane of fire. Some of the items sold here cannot be found anywhere else, though for some reason this bubble is comprimised at the top and bottom, letting some harmful effects seep into the residents. 
<h4>Chroma</h4> This bubble is jointly owned by the government and many corperations, it is used as a sports arena for sports such as zero-gravity enercycle racing and a type of flamboyant wrestlign in which participants are covered in multiple layers of illusion magic. The games are broadcast all over the pact worlds.
<h4>Corona Artifact Divers HQ</h4> Corona is home to a community of explorers who have devoted their lives to discovering artifacts of the so-called "deep cultures" within the suns inner layers. these artifact divers have honed technological and magical techniques for traveling far below the archipelago, beyond even the reaches of the sunskimmers. They wait for solar flares and other ejecta to explode outward and then probe these phenomena, occasionally turning up artifacts and objects. What they have shared with outsiders thus far has been unimpressive, merely suggestive lumps of strange metals, but not everything the divers collect sees the open market the society of the divers is close knit and carefree, evoking a religious commune in their lack of hierarchy and overlay of spirtualism
<h4>Dawnshore Spaceport</h4> Dawnshore spaceport is a sprawling facility of landing pads, launch tubes, maintenance bays, and other structures in service to the numerous spacecraft that visit the archipelago. As the protected tunnel leading into the sun toward the archipelago empties out directly onto the dawnshore bubble, this spaceport is the only place for standard starships to land; vessels that can traverse the suns energies on their own can dock in other bubble cities, but the  talented mechanics of dawnshore spaceport make this area a popular destination for them as well. The spaceport is lousy with charlatans and con artists who prey on incoming pilgrims and other travelers but attempts by local serenites to celar them out have met with little success. 
<h4>Deep cultures institute</h4> While the sun atlas group often acts as if any structures within the sun are only archaeological in nature, the nearby deep cultures institute takes the opposite tack. They believe the sun is still inhjabited bu at least one species of incalculabvble power and wisdom, the scholars of the deep cultures institute maintain a veneer of science, but they are widely derided as mystics or even cultists of the outer gods.
<h4>Far Portal</h4> Located on the opposite side of the sun from the burning Archipelago, a stable starship-sized portal opens onto a particularly inhospitable region of the elemental plane of fire. few forays into the portal have returned to speak of their experiences on the other side, but a permanent research station has been established in orbit near the portal to study it. To date, no non-material plane objects or creatures have been recorded exiting the portal, though recently, scientists have been picking up strang readings from it
<h4>Fireside Foundry</h4>Owned by Automatrix robotics of Aballon, fireside foundry works primarily to forge enhancements for androids and robots. The buissness of the foundry serves partly as a hand of friendship between the anacites of aballon and the human-built androids- two forms of artificial intelligence whom auromatrix believes can always be closer allies. Fireside foundry outfits androids and servitor robots to work in hazardous and inimical enviroments, and nothing in its public reports suggests that ir has any interest in the military applications of its enhancements 
<h4>Floating gardens</h4>The floating gardens are the hear of verdeon. Here, parts of the platform drift freely about one another in a delicate ballet of greenery dappled with sunlight and shade. The floating gardens are a green jewel in the archipelago's crown.
<h4>Greenbelts</h4>Most of Verdeon is given over to high-value horticulture, the sunward side forming the systems largest greenhouse, where heat-loving plants thrive in a world of universal day, modulated perfectly by slowly rotating shade players that give just the right amount of respite from the sun. The spaceward side of verdeon is a land of shade plants, with mirror arrays reflecting just enough light to keep the exotic flora growing and blooming. These shaded greenbelts are riddled with streams, waterfalls, and pathjs such that the boundary between habitation, garden, and wilderness is blurred
<h4>Lucent Shipyards</h4>This small bubble was completely empty when the archipelago was discovered, and its area has since been given over to large shipbuilding projects. A number of pact worlds corporations own docks within the Lucent Shhipyards- most norable the sanjaval spaceflight systems- and these companies use the space to work on expermental designs. this has resulted in a number of innovations in hull strength and radiation shielding, with many of the engineers believing they are close to a few breakthroughs in the realm of interplanar travel.
<h4>NatuReal Solar Bureau</h4> Occupying a towering corperate block near the heart of fireside, NatuReal compounds Ltd. controls much of the high-yield agriculture in the archipelago and orbiting the sun. NatuReal has a significant research and development department, and its intellectual property portfolio is unimaginably valuble. 
<h4>Pleasure Domes</h4>Lush Verdeon provides a respite from the unbroken expanses of metal and solar flam that make up most of the burning archipelago. While horticulture is the main function of the bubble-city, tourism ultimately drives much of the archipelagos economy. A number of pleasure domes- buildings ranging from high-end spas to casinos- are located in verdeon. small crime families who skulked trheir way onto the archipelago when it was first being settled run more of these domes, including the vestrani gaming complex, than the senate would care to admit.
<h4>Radiant Cathedral</h4>
